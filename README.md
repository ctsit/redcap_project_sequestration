# REDCap Project Sequestration State
Provides REDCap global admins a new project state that "sequestrates" access from local users - including project administrators. A "sequestered" project is different from Archived or Inactive states since project admins don't have any control over this new state.

## Prerequisites
- REDCap >= 8.0.3

## Installation
- Clone this repo into `<redcap-root>/modules/project_sequestration_state_v<version_number>`.
- Go to **Control Center > Manage External Modules** and enable Project Sequestration State.

## Configuration
TODO.
